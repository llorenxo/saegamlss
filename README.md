The **saegamlss** package provides a collection of functions for the estimation of unit-level Small Area Estimation (SAE) models within the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) framework. The package was originally developed for the article Small Area Estimation of Household Economic Indicators under Unit-Level Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape by L. Mori and M.R. Ferrante, published in the Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology (13(1), 160â€“196). It implements the complete workflow, ranging from the creation of artificial populations to model selection and the estimation of small area indicators together with their variances. The estimation routines included in the package were also used in the study Estimating the consumption-based carbon footprint: a small area model as a tool for place-based policies by L. Mori and M.R. Ferrante, published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics), qlaf041. In addition, the package includes functions for the estimation of inequality measures such as the Gini, Atkinson and Theil indices, together with their variability obtained through a nonparametric bootstrap procedure at the unit level, which is particularly useful in situations where covariates are not available.
